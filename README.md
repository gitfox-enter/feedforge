## ⚙️ Configuration

### CORS Proxy (For Cross-Origin Feeds)

Due to browser security restrictions, some RSS feeds require a CORS proxy to load. FeedForge provides several solutions:

#### Solution 1: Public Proxy (Limited)
FeedForge includes a public proxy, but it may have rate limits. For personal use, we recommend:

#### Solution 2: Cloudflare Worker (Free, Recommended)
1. Go to [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com)
2. Create a new Worker
3. Paste the contents of `proxy-worker.js`
4. Deploy and copy your Worker URL
5. In FeedForge: Settings → Advanced → Custom Proxy
6. Enter: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/?url=`

#### Solution 3: Tampermonkey Script
If you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed:
1. Install `FeedForge-Tampermonkey.js`
2. The script intercepts fetch requests and bypasses CORS
3. Works on localhost and GitHub Pages

#### Solution 4: RSSHub (No Proxy Needed)
Use [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub) to generate CORS-enabled feeds:
- Many RSSHub instances already support CORS
- Self-host for full control
- No proxy configuration needed

## 🎨 Themes

FeedForge offers three carefully designed themes:

| Theme | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Light** | Clean white with coral accents | Daytime reading |
| **Dark** | Pure black OLED-friendly | Night reading, battery saving |
| **Sepia** | Warm parchment tones | Extended reading sessions |

Each theme includes:
- Properly adjusted colors (not just inverted)
- Optimized contrast ratios
- Consistent design language
